Project Notes
-------------
W2D5 Todo Project
	- Use cmd, *args = gets.chomp.split(' ') to freely pull out values
	- When printing with a one line if, use quotes ... (condition ? truthy : falsey)
	- String.ljust(20) to add padding until it is 20 chars long
W3D1 Enumerables
	- &blk looks for situations where you do method_call {stuff}
	- prc looks for situations where you do method_call(prc), where prc = Proc.new(...)
	- & turns things into procs if they aren't already
	- yield(...) is the same as prc.call(...)
	
W3D1 Ghost
	- words = File.open("./dictionary.txt")
	- Set.new([...])
	- words.readlines.map(&:chomp)
		... :chomp creates a simple proc, & turns it into a proc
		... readlines reads each line as items in an array
	- Use print for getting user input, as it leaves out the string quotes
