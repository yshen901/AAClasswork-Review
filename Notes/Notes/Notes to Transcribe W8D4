- Array methods: map, forEach, join
- Math methods	: Math.random() returns a random number < 1
- Method types	: Class.method is a class method, Class.prototype.method is an instance method
- Closures	: You can use closures to make variables private, for example like the ++counter example ...  basically return a closure that works on the function


- Jasmine	: the spec system javascript uses
		  run the SpecRunner.html file to use it, and click Spec List to see all failed specs.
- Array init	: grid = new Array(8).fill(null).map(() => new Array(8)); ...	creates an 8x8 grid. The first fill null is so you can actually map
	   	  									because otherwise the array index would be undefined...which is unmappable.
	   	  									second array however cna be filled with undefined.
	   	  									
- Underscore	: _method indicates a private method, although in Javascript everything is technically public
- Error	: To throw an error, do "throw new Error("...");
		  If I do for (let i; i < 9; i++) ... the errors can be very weird
