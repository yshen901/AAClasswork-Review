BOX Model
	margin		does not affect size of the box, but enforces a private space around the box
	padding	between the box content and the border of the box
	border		between the padding of the box and the margin of a box	
	
	
Display Types
	display:
		   inline	 	keeps line height
		   		 	pushes other elements horizontally not vertically
		   		 	can't specify height and width properties
		   		 	
		   block	 	does not respect line height
		   		 	takes up as much horizontal space as possible
		   			can specify width and height
		   			
		   inline-block	inline, but forces elements around to respect horiontal
		   				and vertical space
		   			can specify width and height		
		   			
		   none		nothing
		   
		   flex		makes a flexbox
		   				flex items use flex-direction
		   				flex containers use justify-content and align-items
		   
		   
Inheritance (can put :inherit for any property)

CSS Reset (can copy paste this from somewhere, useful to clear everything)

Float
	should never have float and position for the same element
	float is like images in magazines that have text floating around them
	allows us to align elements horizontally
	
Clearfix	
	a parent with only floated elements has 0 height
	use a :after pseudo-selector to insert an empty string
		section:after {
		  content: ""; 	/* Empty content string */
		  display: block; 	/* Only block elements can clear */
		  clear: both; 	/* Tells element to fall below any floated elements
		  			   it shares a line with */ 
		}

Grid System
	Making a grid container
		#garden {
		  display: grid;
		  grid-template-columns: 20% 20% 20% 20% 20%; /* 1fr (fraction), 100px, 3em alo work */
		  grid-template-rows: 20% 20% 20% 20% 20%;
		  grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 20%); 	/* functions same as above */
		}
	Affecting grid position (all below also work with grid-row..)
		#water {
		  grid-column-start:1;	/* One value at the spot */	
		  grid-column-end:5;	/* Keeps adding until the end */
		  grid-column: 2/4;	/* Starts at 2, ends at 4 */
		  grid-area: 1/4/6/5; 	/* row-start / col-start / row-end / col-end */
		}
