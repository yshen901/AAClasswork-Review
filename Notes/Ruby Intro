Numbers and Booleans
	PEMDAS is valid
	Integer division results in an integer ... make one a decimal to get a decimal
	
	Comparison operators	: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
	Number operators	: +, -, *, /, %
	Boolean operators	: !, &&, ||

Strings
	print ... minimal formatting, no new line
	puts  ... some formatting, has new line
	p     ... has new line, and has information on what type of data was printed
			p "42" --> "42"
			p 42 --> 42

	str.length 			--> returns length
	str[0]	   			--> returns first character
	"hello" + " world" + "!" 	--> "hello world!"

Useful Shorthands
	count += 1 			--> same as count = count + 1
	count -= 1			--> same as count = count - 1

	is_even = num % 2 == 0		--> works for setting it to true/false

Methods
	define with def method {...} end
	call with either method or method(...)
	return ... last line is implicitly returned, use "return ..." to return otherwise

Conditionals
	if num > 0
		puts "positive"
	elsif num < 0
		puts "negative"
	else
		puts "zero"
	end

Loops
	while counter <= 5
		...
	end

	for i in 1...5
		...
	end

	Use "break" to break out of loops
	Use "next" to skip to next iteration

Arrays
	Can break lines when declaring
	Use ".length" to get length
	Use shovel to add items
		arr << new_ele 
	Use indexing to edit existing items
		arr[0] = new_ele
